EDITING CRON TABLE

    crontable -e

Crontab, stands for cron table, which is a list of commands scheduled to run at regular time intervals on the system.

If we need to schedule any task on Linux, we should basically edit the crontab file. We can do that using the below command.

crontab -e              # edit the crontab file
crontab -l              # list current cron tasks
crontab -u username -e  # edit other users's crontab file
Editing the crontab file is not complex, but we should first learn how to set a date and time using 5 * on that file. There are six fields that we use on every cron task line. Those are explained in detail in the below picture.
crontab format

Let’s see few examples;
* * * * * <shell command>   # execute cron job every minute
0 1 * * * <shell command>   # execute cron job every day at 1 a.m.
* * 1 * * <shell command>   # execute every minute in January
* * * * 6 <shell command>   # execute every minute on every saturday
0 1/15 * jan,jun mon,fri <command> # execute at every 1 a.m. and 3
                                     p.m. every monday and friday on
                                     january and june

We can also use some regular expressions to define the date part.
* = Any/All values           # e.g. *
- = Range of values          # e.g. 1-5 
, = Multiple/List of values  # e.g. 1,2,3
/ = Step values              # e.g. 1/3

Finally let’s create some crontab tasks. Create a cron task writes the system date information every day at 1 p.m. to the date.log file.
crontab -e
0 13 * * * echo date >> /home/ec2-user/date.log

Create a cron task updates and upgrades our server every Sunday at 3 a.m.
0 3 * * sun sudo yum update -y

List the cron tasks.
crontab -l
